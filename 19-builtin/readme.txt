HashMap is implemented as a hash table, and there is no ordering on keys or values

TreeMap is implemented based on red-black tree structure, and it is ordered by the key.

LinkedHashMap preserves the insertion order

Hashtable is synchronized, in contrast to HashMap.

Heaps are based on the notion of a complete tree, for which we gave an informal definition earlier.
